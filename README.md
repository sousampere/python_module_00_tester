# 42 Python_module_00_tester

A python tool created for 42 students. Check your python module 00 with it !

## Usage

To run this program, you first need to clone it **inside your own repo, in its own folder (your_repo/python_module_00_tester)**.

Make sure your python interpreter is in the correct version (`python3 --version`) as the subject requires Python > 3.10. You can manualy change the python binary path inside the Makefile (variable $(PYTHON)) if needed.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sousampere/python_module_00_tester.git
```

Launch the checker

```bash
  make
```

Or, for specific exercises :

```bash
  make ex0
```

You can also use directly the python script after doing a `make move` to move the files alongside your ex0, ex1, (...) folders.
